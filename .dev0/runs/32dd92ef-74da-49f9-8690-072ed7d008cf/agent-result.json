  "commitMessage": "feat: implement data persistence layer with LocalStorage, Zod schemas, and useStorage hook",
  "prTitle": "Data Persistence Layer Implementation",
  "prBody": "Implemented the data persistence layer using LocalStorage and Zod for validation.

Changes:
- Added `zod` dependency.
- Created `src/lib/schemas.ts` for Zod schemas and TypeScript interfaces (Video, Note, Tag).
- Created `src/lib/storage.ts` for raw storage operations with validation.
- Created `src/hooks/use-storage.tsx` providing `StorageContext`, `StorageProvider`, and `useStorage` hook with full CRUD capabilities.
- Updated `src/main.tsx` to wrap the application with `StorageProvider`.
- Added unit tests in `tests/storage.test.ts` to verify storage logic.",
  "notes": "The storage layer is fully functional and integrated. The `useStorage` hook provides methods for managing videos, notes, and tags. Data is persisted to `localStorage` under the key `tubemarker-data`."
