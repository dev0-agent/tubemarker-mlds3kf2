Key changes:
- Added a robust YouTube URL parser in `src/lib/youtube.ts` that handles standard, short, and embed URLs, as well as timestamps.
- Created `AddVideoDialog` component which allows users to add videos by URL with optional title. It validates the URL using Zod and redirects to the player upon success.
- Integrated the `AddVideoDialog` into the `Dashboard` page.
- Added `Toaster` from `sonner` to `App.tsx` for user feedback.
- Improved `useStorage` hook to utilize the new URL parser.","notes":"The YouTube URL parser handles various formats including `youtu.be`, `youtube.com/watch`, and embed URLs, extracting both video ID and start time. The UI uses shadcn components and provides immediate feedback via toasts."}
